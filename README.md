# INTRODUCTION to this n-back test platform

## 1 What is n-back?
The n-back task is a continuous performance task that is commonly used as an assessment in psychology and cognitive neuroscience to measure a part of working memory and working memory capacity. The n-back was introduced by Wayne Kirchner in 1958. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-back for more information.
## 2 Installation
Copy the files to a folder of your choice and start the software by running nback_main.py with your favourite Python-IDE or from the command prompt. The software was developed using Python version 3.10.2, but as nothing really fancy is being used, somewhat older and newer versions should work. 
## 3 Instructions for use
## 4 Settings
## 5 Improvement recommendations for you to consider doing yourself!
- Error control! 
-- E.g., messing around manually with the settings file - unless you know what you are doing - will cause havoc!
-- Also using invalid log filenames, letters instead of numbers (why would you do that?), or not following the instructions might cause interesting behaviour...
- Supporting letters instead of/in addition to numbers in the game itself
- Now the user needs to change the display resolution completely manually by giving x and y resolution. Change this so the user can select from a list of resolutions supported by the user's hardware.
